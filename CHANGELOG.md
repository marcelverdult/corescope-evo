# Changelog

## [2.4.0] — "The Observatory" — 2026-03-22

146 commits. The packet viewer grew up.

### Highlights

- **Full observation model** — every packet now shows all observers, their individual paths, signal data, and timestamps. Expand any grouped packet to see how it propagated across the mesh. Sort by observer, path length, or time. Header row updates to match.
- **Distance analytics** — haversine-calculated hop distances, link-type breakdown (R↔R, C↔R, C↔C), histogram, top 20 longest single hops, top 10 longest multi-hop paths. View any hop or path on the live map.
- **Realistic propagation visualization** — "Realistic" toggle on live map buffers packets and animates all observation paths simultaneously, showing how packets actually spread through the mesh.
- **Regional filtering everywhere** — shared multi-select region filter component across all tabs. Node region assignment based on ADVERT broadcasts (local presence), not data packet routing.
- **Channel decryption overhaul** — rainbow table of pre-computed keys, simplified key architecture, zero-API live updates via WebSocket, 1-second ticking timestamps.
- **Polished filter toolbar** — consistent control sizing, logical grouping with separators, tooltips on everything, ascending/descending sort options.

### Added
- Observation-level deeplinks (`#/packets/HASH?obs=OBSERVER_ID`)
- Observation detail pane (click any child row for its specific data)
- Observation sort: Observer / Path ↑↓ / Time ↑↓ with persistent preference
- Ungrouped mode flattens all observations into individual rows
- Sort help tooltip (ⓘ) explaining each mode
- Distance/Range analytics tab with haversine calculations
- View on Map buttons for distance leaderboard entries
- Realistic packet propagation mode on live map
- Packet propagation time in detail pane
- Replay sends all observations with realistic animation
- Paths-through section on node detail (desktop + mobile)
- Regional filters on all tabs (shared RegionFilter component)
- Favorites filter on live map (packet-level, not node markers)
- Configurable map defaults via `config.json`
- Hash prefix labels on map with spiral deconfliction + callout lines
- Channel rainbow table (pre-computed keys for common names)
- Zero-API live channel updates via WebSocket
- Channel message dedup by packet hash
- Channel name tags (blue pill) in packet detail column
- Shareable channel URLs (`#/channels/HASH`)
- API key required for POST endpoints
- HTTPS support (lincomatic PR #105)
- Graceful shutdown (lincomatic PR #109)
- Filter bar: logical grouping, consistent 34px height, help tooltips

### Changed
- Channel keys: plain `String(channelHash)`, `hashChannels` for auto-derived SHA256
- Node region filtering uses ADVERT-based index (accurate local presence vs mesh-wide routing)
- Header row reflects first sorted observation's data
- Max hop distance filter: 1000km → 300km (LoRa record ~250km)
- Route view labels use deconflicted divIcons
- Channels page hides encrypted messages, shows only decrypted
- Dark mode: active filter buttons retain accent styling
- Region dropdown: `IATA - Friendly Name` format, proper sizing

### Fixed
- Header row showed longest path instead of first observer's path
- Observer/path mismatch when earlier observation arrives later
- Auto-seeding fake data on empty DB (now requires `--seed` flag)
- Channel "10h ago" bug (used stale `first_seen` instead of current time)
- Stale UI: wrong ID type for packet lookup after insert
- ADVERT timestamp validation rejecting valid nodes
- Channels page API spam on every WS update
- Duplicate observations in expanded view
- Analytics RF 500 error (stack overflow with 193K observations)
- Region filter SQL using non-existent column
- Channel hash: decimal→hex, keyed by decrypted name
- Corrupted repeater entries (ADVERT validation at ingestion)
- Hash_size: uses newest ADVERT, precomputed at startup
- Tab backgrounding: skip animations, resume cleanly
- Feed panel position (obscured by VCR bar)
- Hop disambiguation anchored from sender origin
- Packet hash case normalization for deeplinks
- Sort help tooltip rendering (CSS pseudo-elements don't support newlines)

### Performance
- `/api/analytics/distance`: 3s → 630ms
- `/api/analytics/topology`: 289ms → 193ms
- `/api/observers`: 3s → 130ms
- `/api/nodes`: 50ms → 2ms (precomputed hash_size)
- Event loop max: 3.2s → 903ms (startup only)
- Pre-warm yields event loop via `setImmediate`
- Client-side hop resolution
- SQLite manual PASSIVE checkpointing
- Single API call for packet expand (was 3)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Packet Deduplication**: Normalized storage with `transmissions` and `observations` tables — packets seen by multiple observers are stored once with linked observation records
- **Observation count badges**: Packets page shows 👁 badge indicating how many observers saw each transmission
- **`?expand=observations`**: API query param to include full observation details on packet responses
- **`totalTransmissions` / `totalObservations`**: Health and analytics APIs return both deduped and raw counts
- **Migration script**: `scripts/migrate-dedup.js` for converting existing packet data to normalized schema
- **Live map deeplinks**: Node detail panel links to full node detail, observer detail, and filtered packets
- **CI validation**: `setup-node` added to deploy workflow for JS syntax checking

### Changed
- In-memory packet store restructured around transmissions (primary) with observation indexes
- Packets API returns unique transmissions by default (was returning inflated observation rows)
- Home page shows "Transmissions" instead of "Packets" for network stats
- Analytics overview uses transmission counts for throughput metrics
- Node health stats include `totalTransmissions` alongside legacy `totalPackets`
- WebSocket broadcasts include `observation_count`

### Fixed
- Packet expand showing only the collapsed row instead of individual observations
- Live page "Heard By" showing "undefined pkts" (wrong field name)
- Recent packets deeplink using query param instead of route path
- Migration script handling concurrent dual-write during live deployment

### Performance
- **8.19× dedup ratio on production** (117K observations → 14K transmissions)
- RAM usage reduced proportionally — store loads transmissions, not inflated observations
