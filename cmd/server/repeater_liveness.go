// GetRepeaterRelayInfo returns relay-activity information for a node by
// scanning the byPathHop index for non-advert packets that name the

// 1h/24h hop counts, and whether the latest appearance falls within
// windowHours.
//
// Cost: O(N) over the indexed entries for `pubkey`. The byPathHop index
// is bounded by store eviction; on real data this is small per-node.
//
// Note on self-as-source: byPathHop is keyed by every hop in a packet's
// resolved path, including the originator. For ADVERT packets that's the
// node itself, which is filtered above by the payloadTypeAdvert check.
// For non-advert packets a node "originates" rather than "relays" only
// when it is the source; we don't currently have a clean signal for that
// distinction, so the count here is *path-hop appearances in non-advert
// packets*. In practice for a repeater nearly all such appearances are
// relay hops (the firmware doesn't originate user traffic), so this is
// the right approximation for issue #662.
